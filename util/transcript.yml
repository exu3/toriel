  Oh hello... I don't think I recognize you.
  ...you must be new in town.

  i just sent you a dm, you can tell by the :ping: to the left

house:
  hello: Hello my child, you may stay here with me for as long as you want.
  venture: But I imagine youâ€™d like to venture forward, as many before you have doneâ€¦
  beforeGo: Oh, but we don't have to get into that right now. Let's find something fun to keep you busy. Would you like to help me paint the house?

    Ah, you're already done reading!?
    No, of course it's not a problem, my child. I just wasn't expecting you to go through it so quickly.
    Maybe you can occupy yourself with one of the boardgames we have in the living room?
    I personally enjoy <#${this.t('channels.whack-a-mole')}> and <#${this.t('channels.tetris')}>
  leave: I understand you want to leave the house to venture into town. Are you sure you really want to continue, my child?

      You only wanted to say hello...? Well then.
      'Hello!'
      I hope that suffices. Hee hee.

      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You wanted to say hello again?
      'Salutations!'
      Is that enough?

      Are you bored?
      I should have given you some <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.wordle')}|games> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.whack-a-mole')}|to> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.uno-games')}|play>.

      Hello, my child.
      Sorry, I do not have much to say.
      It was nice to hear your voice, though.

      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You want to know more about me?
      Well, I am afraid there is not much to say.
      I am just a silly little lady who wants to help everyone!

      We could paint the walls at my house ${this.t('themes.array')}
      Or, if you prefer another color, you can find one for yourself in <#${this.t('channels.slack-themes')}>
